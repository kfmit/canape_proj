% first create two random data sets of size 1000
x1=randn(1000);     % make data 1
x2=randn(1000)+1; % make data 2 and make it "SOME OFFSET" higher than the other one
db=0.1;             % establish distance between bins
bins=-10:db:10;     % create bin edges for the histogram

% Now create histcounts of the two variables
% histcounts functions: val1 = the number of instances in this bin
% bin1= the bin edges, not that this comes back as the same input as bins!

% i chose to get ride of the probability normalization
[val1, bin1]=histcounts(x1,bins,'Normalization','pdf');

% maximum distance between modes: distance between the modes
% our pairwise dist?
% this should be pretty damn close to what we set as the offset above
dist_mode=bin2_c(ind_bin2)-bin1_c(ind_bin1)

% total variation distance - literally how much distance is there between
% every count of every bin, larger number is more differnet
